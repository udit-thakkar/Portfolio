# [Project 1: Student Performance-Machine Learning](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/Student-Performance-Machine-Learning-Project)
* Univariate analysis techniques such as histograms, kernel density plots, and box plots were used to understand the distribution and spread of individual variables in the dataset.
* Bivariate analysis techniques such as scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices were used to explore the relationship between different variables in the dataset.
* Outliers and anomalies were detected using box plots and scatter plots.
* Correlation analysis was performed to identify the most significant features in the dataset.
* The EDA process provided valuable insights into the data, which were used to inform the preprocessing and modeling steps.
* The dataset was preprocessed by separating numerical and categorical features and stored in a new variable.
* Preprocessing techniques such as column transformer, standard scaler, and OneHotEncoder were used to prepare the data for modeling.
* An Evaluate Function was created to calculate various evaluation metrics after training each model.
* The models were then sorted by their best r2 score.
* Finally, a Linear Regression model was used for the project.

# [Project 2: Customer Sentiment Analysis with NLP, TextBlob & BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/NLP-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis)
* The project performed sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* I used NLTK toolkit for NLP and Beautifulsoup for web scraping of customer reviews by building a block of code which scraped the name of the person who reviewed the product, how much ratings given, title of the review and the whole review.
* All the reviews were then analysed through Pandas dataframe which later helped to analyse Word count, Review Length, Stopword_Count	and Stopword Rate.
* High emphasis was made to optimize the subjectivity and polarity by using the inflect engine to convert numerical data to text data, removing punctuations, cleaning the review by removing the stopwords and later used WordLemmatizer to get the root word of the comments.
* The aim of the project was to identify whether the reviews are positive, negative or neutral. TextBlob is used to find the subjectivity and polarity of the reviews, and then sentiment is determined based on the scores.
