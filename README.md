# [Project 1: Student Performance-Machine Learning](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/Student-Performance-Machine-Learning-Project)
* Univariate analysis techniques such as histograms, kernel density plots, and box plots were used to understand the distribution and spread of individual variables in the dataset.
* Bivariate analysis techniques such as scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices were used to explore the relationship between different variables in the dataset.
* Outliers and anomalies were detected using box plots and scatter plots.
* Correlation analysis was performed to identify the most significant features in the dataset.
* The EDA process provided valuable insights into the data, which were used to inform the preprocessing and modeling steps.
* The dataset was preprocessed by separating numerical and categorical features and stored in a new variable.
* Preprocessing techniques such as column transformer, standard scaler, and OneHotEncoder were used to prepare the data for modeling.
* An Evaluate Function was created to calculate various evaluation metrics after training each model.
* The models were then sorted by their best r2 score.
* Finally, a Linear Regression model was used for the project.

# [Project 2: Customer Sentiment Analysis with NLP, TextBlob & BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/NLP-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis)
* This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* It uses NLTK toolkit for NLP and Beautifulsoup for web scraping of customer reviews. 
* The aim of the project is to identify whether the reviews are positive, negative or neutral. TextBlob is used to find the subjectivity and polarity of the reviews, and then sentiment is determined based on the scores.
