<h2>About</h2>
<p>As a Bachelors of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering and <strong>Masters of Engineering in Industrial Engineering graduate</strong>, I have always been fascinated by the power of analytics. In mid-2021, I discovered the world of <strong>Data Science, Business Intelligence, and automation</strong>, and it has been my passion ever since.

My interest in these fields stems from a desire to leverage my industrial engineering degree, and I have spent countless hours self-learning and mastering the necessary tools and skills. I have experience with a range of tools, including <strong>Tableau, PowerBI, Python, Advanced Excel, ML, NLP, and various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PyTorch, Sci-kit learn, Keras, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and SciPy</strong>.

I am continually pushing myself to learn more and stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments, and I believe that the possibilities for innovation in this field are endless. I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to drive insights and optimize operations for businesses, and I am confident that my analytical mindset and expertise will be valuable assets to any team.</p>

# [Project 1: Student Performance-Machine Learning](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/Student-Performance-Machine-Learning-Project)
* Univariate analysis techniques such as histograms, kernel density plots, and box plots were used to understand the distribution and spread of individual variables in the dataset.
* Bivariate analysis techniques such as scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices were used to explore the relationship between different variables in the dataset.
* Outliers and anomalies were detected using box plots and scatter plots.
* Correlation analysis was performed to identify the most significant features in the dataset.
* The [Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/Student-Performance-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/Student%20Perf%20Indicator.ipynb) process provided valuable insights into the data, which were used to inform the preprocessing and modeling steps.
* The dataset was preprocessed by separating numerical and categorical features and stored in a new variable.
* Preprocessing techniques such as column transformer, standard scaler, and OneHotEncoder were used to prepare the data for modeling.
* An Evaluate Function was created to calculate various evaluation metrics after training each model.
* The models were then sorted by their best r2 score.
* Finally, a [Linear Regression](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/ML-Projects/blob/main/notebooks/Model%20Training%20Stud%20Perf%20Indi.ipynb) model was used for the project.

# [Project 2: Customer Sentiment Analysis with NLP, TextBlob & BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/NLP-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis)
* The project performed sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* I used NLTK toolkit for NLP and Beautifulsoup for web scraping of customer reviews by building a block of code which scraped the name of the person who reviewed the product, how much ratings given, title of the review and the whole review.
* All the reviews were then analysed through Pandas dataframe which later helped to analyse Word count, Review Length, Stopword_Count	and Stopword Rate.
* High emphasis was made to optimize the subjectivity and polarity by using the inflect engine to convert numerical data to text data, removing punctuations, cleaning the review by removing the stopwords and later used WordLemmatizer to get the root word of the comments.
* The aim of the project was to identify whether the reviews are positive, negative or neutral. TextBlob is used to find the subjectivity and polarity of the reviews, and then sentiment is determined based on the scores.

# [Project 3: Customer Churn Analysis with PowerBI](https://github.com/udit-thakkar/Customer-Churn-Analysis---PowerBI)
* Conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using PowerBI to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior
* Utilized a variety of data visualization techniques such as line charts, scatter plots, and heat maps to present insights in a clear and actionable manner
* Built a dashboard that allowed stakeholders to interact with the data and explore different segments of customers to gain a deeper understanding of the root causes of churn
* Analyzed the relationship between credit type and churn rate, identifying the types of credit products that were associated with higher rates of churn
* Grouped customers into bins based on key attributes such as credit score, income level, and transaction frequency, and determined the ratio of exited customers for each bin, enabling the organization to identify specific customer segments that were at higher risk of churn
